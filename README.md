# JMagma

This repository contains the Java implementation of the Magma compiler. Inside of this repository, no build system
is being used, and consequently may be adapted to Gradle, Maven, or SBT.

The purpose of this repository is to act as a central location and development area for an implementation of the
language that is not itself, i.e. a bootstrap compiler.
